1. Some of the methods offered by strings are:

capitalize() – sets a string to sentence case (capital first letter only);
center() – centers the string inside the field of a known length;
count() – counts the occurrences of a given character;
find() - finds a substring returning its index; (start inclusive, end exclusive);    string.find('text', start, end)
join() – joins all items of a tuple/list into one string (the invoked string acts as item seperator);
lower() – converts all the string's letters into lower-case letters;
lstrip() – removes the white characters from the beginning of the string (or specified adjacent characters);
replace() – replaces a given substring with another;
rfind() – Return the HIGHEST INDEX where substring is found; (start inclusive, end exclusive);
rstrip() – removes the trailing white spaces from the end of the string (or specified adjacent characters);
split() – splits the string into a substring list using a given delimiter;
strip() – removes the leading and trailing white spaces (or specified adjacent characters);
swapcase() – swaps the letters' cases (lower to upper and vice versa)
title() – makes the first letter in each word upper-case;
upper() – converts all the string's letter into upper-case letters.

2. String content can be determined using the following methods (all of them return Boolean values):

endswith() – does the string end with a given substring?
isalnum() – does the string consist only of letters and digits?
isalpha() – does the string consist only of letters?
islower() – does the string consists only of lower-case letters?
isspace() – does the string consists only of white spaces?
isupper() – does the string consists only of upper-case letters?
startswith() – does the string begin with a given substring?
