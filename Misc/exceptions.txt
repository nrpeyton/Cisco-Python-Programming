An AttributeError occurs when trying to access a non-existent property or method of an object (anything following a dot '.').             AttributeError

NameError is raised when you try to access a local or global name (like a variable, function, or class) that has not been defined.        NameError

A TypeError is raised for operations on mismatched data types where the operation doesn't make sense for the data type, (like adding      TypeError
a string to an integer) or when inheritance structures in classes lead to an unclear hierarchy, preventing a consistent method 
resolution order (MRO).

A ValueError is when the data type is correct, but the content within that data type isn't formatted or isn't appropriate for the         ValueError
operation being attempted.  For example, with `i = int("Hello!")` the type is correct because int() can convert other data types
(i.e., a string '123' into an integer), so it expects the string to be formatted as numbers.  The problem is with the contents,
not the data type.

Attempting to open a file that does not exist causes a FileNotFoundError.                                                                 FileNotFoundError
