An AttributeError occurs when trying to access a non-existent property or method of an object (anything following a dot '.').             AttributeError                   BaseException ← Exception ← AttributeError

NameError is raised when you try to access a local or global name (like a variable, function, or class) that has not been defined.        NameError                        BaseException ← Exception ← NameError

A TypeError is raised for operations on mismatched data types where the operation doesn't make sense for the data type, (like adding      TypeError                        BaseException ← Exception ← TypeError
a string to an integer) or when inheritance structures in classes lead to an unclear hierarchy, preventing a consistent method 
resolution order (MRO).

A ValueError is when the data type is correct, but the content within that data type isn't formatted or isn't appropriate for the         ValueError                       BaseException ← Exception ← ValueError
operation being attempted.  For example, with `i = int("Hello!")` the type is correct because int() can convert other data types
(i.e., a string '123' into an integer), so it expects the string to be formatted as numbers.  The problem is with the contents,
not the data type.

FileNotFoundError: Attempting to open a file that does not exist causes a FileNotFoundError.                                              FileNotFoundError                BaseException ← Exception ← OSError ← FileNotFoundError

IndexError is a concrete exception raised when you try to access a non-existent sequence's element (e.g., a list's element).              IndexError                       BaseException ← Exception ← LookupError ← IndexError


ArithmeticError is an abstract exception including all exceptions caused by arithmetic operations like zero division or an                ArithmeticError                  BaseException ← Exception ← ArithmeticError
argument's invalid domain.

KeyError is a concrete exception raised when there is an attempt to access a collection's non-existent element (for example: a            KeyError                         BaseException ← Exception ← LookupError ← KeyError
dictionary's element).



Concrete Exceptions:

ValueError
TypeError
IndexError
KeyError
ImportError
NameError
FileNotFoundError
ZeroDivisionError
AttributeError
SyntaxError


Not Concrete:

BaseException
ArithmeticError
IO Error (was merged into OS Error with 3.3)
OS Error




ORDER (Specific to More General):

try:
    # Some code that might raise different types of exceptions

except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
except ArithmeticError as e:
    print(e)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

SYNTAX: Unnamed exception branch MUST be placed last.
