## Using This Repository

Feel free to explore the folders and documents. Each section is organised to reflect different aspects of the Python syllabus, from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics.

## Contribution

Primarily a personal reference, this repository includes concisely paraphrased lab questions as comments at the beginning of my Python scripts. These serve solely as context introductions for the code.
