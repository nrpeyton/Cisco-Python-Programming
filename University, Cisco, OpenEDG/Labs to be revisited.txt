PCEP Module 4:

-Converting from European 'litres per 100km' to American 'mpg' and vice versa

- 2.4.1.6 LAB: A LED Display (made a good attempt that works, but need to try it with only 7 segments)


PCAP MODULE 4:

- 4.4.1.8 LAB: Struggled with recursion in the directory search lab. Managed to print two out of three output lines correctly 
but decided it wasn't efficient to continue. Reviewed the official solution, which was also flawedâ€”it printed all lines but 
included an incorrect, extra folder in each directory path. My next step is to find a reliable external example focusing on 
recursion for directory traversal.  Original lab below for reference:

                                    LAB: Directory Search with os Module

DIFFICULTY: Easy
TIME: 15-30 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
-Boost skills in OS interaction using Python.
-Implement practical applications of the os module functions.

SCENARIO:
Develop a program to recursively search for directories in a specified path using Python's os module.

[labs_to_be_revisited_directory_tree.png]

FEATURES:
-Implement a function `find` that takes two arguments: `path` and `dir`.
--`path` is where the search begins, and can be either relative or absolute.
--`dir` is the directory name you're searching for.
-Output the absolute paths of any matching directories.
-Execute the search recursively to include all subdirectories.

EXAMPLE:
Input: path="./tree", dir="python"
Output:
.../tree/python
.../tree/cpp/other_courses/python
.../tree/c/other_courses/python
